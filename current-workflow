# Current Appointment Workflow

1. Patient books appointment
2. Appointment logged in clinic system
3. Generic reminder sent (SMS/call)
4. Patient forgets or cannot attend
5. Appointment slot wasted
6. Staff reacts after no-show occurs

## Key Gaps
- No risk prediction
- No prioritization of high-risk patients
- Reactive instead of proactive intervention
